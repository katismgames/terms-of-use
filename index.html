  <h1>Katism Games Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Company:</strong> Katism Games</p>
  <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:katismgames.help@gmail.com">katismgames.help@gmail.com</a></p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the mobile game(s) and related services (“Service”) provided by Katism Games (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility and Age</h2>
  <p>You must be of legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction. If a minor uses the Service or makes an in-app purchase, it is deemed that consent from a legal guardian has been obtained. The Company may assist a guardian in confirming or canceling certain transactions, to the extent permitted by the relevant platform policy.</p>

  <h2>2. License</h2>
  <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Service on a device you own or control, strictly in accordance with these Terms. All other rights are reserved by the Company and its licensors.</p>

  <h2>3. Account Registration and Management</h2>
  <p>1. Certain features may require you to create an account. You must provide accurate and current information.</p>
  <p>2. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
  <p>3. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or applicable laws.</p>
  <p>4. You may request account deletion through the in-game settings. After you submit the request, your account will be permanently deleted following a <strong>15-day grace period</strong>. During this period, you may cancel your request.</p>
  <p>5. After deletion is completed, related data (including gameplay history and virtual items) cannot be restored.</p>

  <h2>4. Paid Services and Virtual Items</h2>
  <p>1. The Service may include paid content or virtual items (“Virtual Items”). Such items grant a right to use within the Service; they do not represent ownership.</p>
  <p>2. If an in-app purchased item is delivered to your in-game mailbox and <strong>any part of it is claimed</strong>, the purchase is considered used and may no longer be eligible for withdrawal or refund.</p>
  <p>3. Where a refund is permitted, it must follow the applicable store’s (Google Play, App Store, etc.) refund process and conditions.</p>
  <p>4. If your account is deleted or the Service is terminated, any remaining Virtual Items or in-game currency will automatically expire and will not be refunded.</p>
  <p>5. The Company may change the content, price, or availability of Virtual Items for operational reasons, but such changes will not retroactively affect completed purchases.</p>

  <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
  <p>When using the Service, you agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>violate any applicable law or public order;</li>
    <li>harass, threaten, defame, or discriminate against other users;</li>
    <li>hack, reverse engineer, exploit, or otherwise tamper with the Service or servers;</li>
    <li>use bots, scripts, macros, or other automated tools to interact with the Service;</li>
    <li>upload or distribute illegal, obscene, violent, or infringing content;</li>
    <li>interfere with the normal operation or security of the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
  <p>The Company handles personal data in accordance with applicable laws and its separate Privacy Policy, which explains what data is collected and how it is used and retained. By using the Service, you agree to that Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content and materials within the Service, including software, graphics, text, logos, audio, and video, are owned by the Company or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our prior written consent.</p>

  <h2>8. Service Changes and Suspension</h2>
  <p>The Company may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the Service at any time for operational or technical reasons. We will notify users through in-Service announcements or other reasonable means. Unless otherwise required by law, the Company will not be liable for losses arising from such changes.</p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>1. The Company uses reasonable efforts to provide the Service securely and continuously. However, the Company is not responsible for service interruptions or failures caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including natural disasters, power outages, network or platform failures, or unlawful acts of third parties.</p>
  <p>2. The Company is not responsible for damages arising from your breach of these Terms or your negligent use of the Service.</p>
  <p>3. Where the Company’s liability cannot be fully excluded under applicable law, the Company’s liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by such law, and in any case to direct and verifiable damages only.</p>
  <p>4. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for loss of profit, revenue, data, or goodwill.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will announce the effective date and the key changes within the Service or via email. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date will be deemed acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Service shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located at the Company’s principal place of business.</p>
